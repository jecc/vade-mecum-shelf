**Vade Mecum Shelf** is a collection of utilities wrapped into one single app, built with [Electron](https://electron.atom.io).

It works on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows operating systems.

Its *look and feel* is partly inspired by the brilliant [Electron API Demos](https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos) app, but it makes use of a more dynamic modular approach: each utility is made of an independent, self-contained folder including all necessary files.

## Features

- The app window is resizable; its title displays the currently selected utility name next to the app name.

- The visibility of the navigation sidebar can be toggled on and off from the `View` menu, as well as the use of categories.

- It is possible to quickly scroll to the top or to the bottom of the utility from the `View` menu.

- A utility can be displayed either by clicking its name in the navigation sidebar, or by selecting its name from the `Titles` menu.

- From the `Developer` menu, it is possible to reveal the app's executable file, and also to open the user data directory (where the persistent settings get stored), as well as the temporary items directory.

## Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonton-pixel/vade-mecum-shelf
cd vade-mecum-shelf
npm install
npm start
```

If you don't wish to clone, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/tonton-pixel/vade-mecum-shelf/archive/master.zip).

Several scripts are also defined in the `package.json` file to build OS-specific bundles of the app, using the simple yet powerful [Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) Node module.\
For instance, running the following command will create a `Vade Mecum Shelf.app` version for Mac OS X:

```bash
npm run build-darwin
```

## Using

You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/tonton-pixel/vade-mecum-shelf/releases) for Mac OS X.

## Known Issues

- In Linux (at least on **Linux Mint 18.2 Sonya** and **Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS**), there is a [bug](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10388) which prevents the window position to be correctly recorded between consecutive runs, a slight shift to the bottom right occurs systematically.

- In **Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS**, the Titles menu is never updated whenever one of its items is selected, or when the selection is triggered programmatically. This [bug](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/11386) affects all menus made of radio-buttons items.

- When using the Developer Tools, be careful not to modify the zoom level; this will almost certainly crash the app. This is a documented [bug](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10697) which may be fixed soon, hopefully...

## Limitations

- The Undo/Redo stack is common to all text editing elements of the app, including those which are hidden. This behavior is a known shortcoming and cannot be changed or improved for the time being.

- Although this app has been developed from the start with multiple platforms in mind, it has only been successfully tested on Mac OS X (Yosemite 10.10.5 and El Capitan 10.11.6), and on two Linux *flavors*, [Linux Mint 18.2 Sonya](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=237) and [Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/), installed into [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
